title: Ending 2020 On The Road
description: After having written about the importance of county markets / groceries to rural areas, I dig in for a quick case study of those in the southern-middle-Tennessee area, within about a half hour radius from my office.

<p>I've been really lucky in 2020 - have managed to avoid COVID-19, my family has stayed safe and healthy, and we've all remained employed. Grateful would be an understatement.</p>

<p>As part of our year-end festivities, I was able to recruit my oldest son (currently 4 years old) to be my partner as we collected the rest of the north Alabama counties and grabbed a few in Mississippi as well.</p>



<h2>Collecting with a Partner</h2>

<p>County collecting for me - barring a few day trips - has been a solitary affair. Things just hadn't worked out to have family or friends along for the ride. As part of Christmas, we got my son a sleeping bag and told him to get ready for a car camping adventure - he was elated!</p>

<p>Since this was his first overnight county collecting journey, there were a lot of unknowns. How would car camping logistics work? Can we successfully socially distance? Would things be less fun since we can't do as many museums or tourist-focused attractions?</p>

<p>We were about to find out!</p>



<h2>The Route</h2>

<p>Like I advise, we had a general route that we wanted to follow: drive south to Decatur, AL, make our way across to Mississippi, loop around and finish in Florence, AL before driving back to Nashville.</p>

<p>We didn't have any set timeline for when we hit all the counties, so there was no pressure to hustle. We were game for any diversion or fun aside - of which we found many! </p>

<h2>Kicking Things Off</h2>

<p>We got a late start on Day 1 and didn't get on the road until 1PM! With Decatur being about 1.5hrs south of our starting point, we made tracks to get in what we could before camping out.</p>



<h4>Morgan County (Decatur)</h4>



<h4>Lawrence County (Moulton)</h4>



<h4>Franklin County (Russellville)</h4>



<p>With our 2 playground stops knocked out, we had just enough time and some off-roading at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9NPitbsCYCBztUQ3A" data-type="URL" data-id="https://goo.gl/maps/9NPitbsCYCBztUQ3A">Little Bear Dam</a>.</p>

<p>The only thing left to do was head to Fulton, MS and find a place to get out the sleeping bags and car camp for the night.</p>

<h2>Completing the Loop</h2>

<p>Day 2, we were up with the sun - starting with Fulton. By breakfast we had seen Tupelo, MS. By mid-morning we had added the rest of the Mississippi county seats of Booneville, Corinth, and Iuka...</p>

<p>...including the <em>old</em> county seat of Tishomingo County, Jacinto! </p>

<p>It was quite the change to have to hunt for local playgrounds and pack twice as much food and drink (4 year olds just <em>need</em> their chocolate milk!) in the cooler, but the extra walking and running made the post-trip recovery much easier.</p>

<p>After making such good time, we ate lunch on the Tennessee River in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SfVnSkiLu25jWcoK8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://goo.gl/maps/SfVnSkiLu25jWcoK8">McFarland Park</a> in Florence, AL.</p>

<p>All-in, we covered close to 700 miles - time for an oil change!</p>
