<p>One of the great things about traveling to the different county seats is learning so much about the places I've visited. The history is a big reason - from the origin story, times a place was thriving, times they've not done as well, local legends - but also what's there now and how it ties into all of that.</p>

<p>Not being able to just keep it to myself, I'm starting to talk about what I've learned in my research as well as what I've seen in my travels in a podcast called - aptly - <a href="http://www.anchor.fm/countyseats" title="County Seat Podcast" target="_blank">County Seats</a>.</p>

<p>If you're into learning about new places and a little bit about the history of our country, I've love for you to give it a listen.</p>
